          <h4>Relationships</h4>
          <p>Though exploitative and demanding, Rick genuinely cares about his grandson and values their adventures together, possibly making him the only Rick in existence to do so. He hesitates to outwardly show any love or appreciation however, making sure Morty doesn't get cocky.Rick initially cared very little for and paid scarce attention to his granddaughter, saying her opinion meant "very little" to him. As time went on, however, the two began to bond and go on their own adventures, making her, in a sense, Rick's second sidekick. It appears that Rick loves his daughter, and for the most part is kind to her. Rick also treats Beth with more respect than he does the rest of the family.</p>
